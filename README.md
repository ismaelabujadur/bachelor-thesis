# Bachelor Project
Implementation of SVM for regression in python using libraries as sklearn, scipy, pandas...

# What I Learned
* Theoretical SVM bases
* How to read, process, and preprocess data files as CSV.
* Detect, and remove outliers.
* Filter and smooth data with Savitzky-Golay filter.
* Visualize data
* Work with models, train and test them.
* Use different metrics to compare the models (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2...)
* Optimize hyperparameters with some libraries as Optunity, GridSearchCV, ...
* Create ensemble from different models with optimized hyperparameters
