# BachelorProject
Implementation of SVM in python in order to predict the CO2 levels from five different rooms: Kitchen, bedroom, kidsroom, bathroom and living room.

In this project, the support vector machine for the regression algorithm has been analyzed for the identification of operational technical statuses in a smart home.

Data preprocessing has been performed, reducing dimensions for faster computing speed and obtaining better results in the algorithm. Noise reduction, data scale, and normalization have been applied.

Thanks to the different approaches to the problem, it has been possible to compare and see which ones are better for this problem. Two of these implementations got nice results, although the voting ensemble got lower results than creating one model per room. For each implementation the parameters C, Gamma, and Epsilon have been estimated.
